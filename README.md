# Code Refactor

## Description

  I refactored the code for the Horiseon website. Many CSS classes were doing the same thing, so I consolidated them to decrease clutter and improve readability. There were also many semantic HTML tags that weren't being used at all, or being used improperly, so I changed them to increase accessibility. Overall, there shouldn't be any differences in terms of the website's appearance to the user, but it should be much easier to understand the code behind it!
